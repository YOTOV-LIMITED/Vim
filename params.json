Within Visual Studio Code, open the command palette (`Ctrl-Shift-P` / `Cmd-Shift-P`)\r\n2. Select `Install Extension` and search for 'vim' *or* run `ext install vim`\r\n\r\n## F.A.Q.\r\n\r\n#### `j`, `k` and others don't repeat when I hold them down.\r\n\r\nOn OS X, open Terminal and run the following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndefaults write com.microsoft.VSCode ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### How can I bind `jj` to `<escape>`?\r\n\r\n1. Add the following to `settings.json` (open the Command Pallete and search for \"User Settings\"):\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n      \"vim.insertModeKeyBindings\": [\r\n           {\r\n               \"before\": [\"j\", \"j\"],\r\n               \"after\": [\"<escape>\"]\r\n           }\r\n      ]\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. If you want to press `jj` in modes which are not Insert Mode and still have it trigger `<escape>`, do the following as well:\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n      \"vim.otherModesKeyBindings\": [\r\n           {\r\n               \"before\": [\"j\", \"j\"],\r\n               \"after\": [\"<escape>\"]\r\n           }\r\n      ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nBe sure to restart VSCode after making these changes.\r\n\r\n#### How can I bind something like `j` to `gj`? How can I get the equivalent of `:noremap`?\r\n\r\nNotice the problem is that if you did this normally, the `j` in `gj` would be expanded into `gj`, on and on forever. To stop this recursive expansion, use vim.otherModesKeyBindingsNonRecursive!\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n      \"vim.otherModesKeyBindingsNonRecursive\": [\r\n           {\r\n               \"before\": [\"j\"],\r\n               \"after\": [\"g\", \"j\"]\r\n           }\r\n      ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nDon't forget to restart!\r\n\r\n#### How can I enable `ctrl-c` or `ctrl-[` as an alternative to `<escape>`?\r\n\r\nPut the following in your `settings.json`:\r\n\r\n```    \"vim.useCtrlKeys\": true```\r\n\r\nand restart VSCode.\r\n\r\n#### How can I enable `ctrl-f`?\r\n\r\nPut the following in your `settings.json`:\r\n\r\n```    \"vim.useCtrlKeys\": true```\r\n\r\nand restart VSCode.\r\n\r\n#### How can I enable visual block mode with `ctrl-v`?\r\n\r\nPut the following in your `settings.json`:\r\n\r\n```    \"vim.useCtrlKeys\": true```\r\n\r\nand restart VSCode.\r\n\r\n#### Vim option override sequence.\r\n\r\nThe way we load Vim options is slightly different from native Vim as there is some overlap between Code and Vim. The option loading sequence is as below.\r\n\r\n1. `:set {option}` on the fly\r\n2. [TODO] .vimrc.\r\n2. `vim.{option}` from user settings or workspace settings.\r\n3. VS Code configuration\r\n4. VSCodeVim flavored Vim option default values\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nThis project is maintained by a group of awesome [contributors](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim/graphs/contributors) and contributions are extremely welcome :heart:.
